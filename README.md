# A Machine Learning Approach to FFT in OFDM Receiver

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely heavily
on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and its inverse (IFFT) for signal modulation and demodulation. However, while FFT is effective in converting signals
between time-domain and frequency-domain representations, it poses computational challenges, particularly in high-speed communication systems. This
project aims to address this limitation by replacing the conventional FFT process in OFDM receivers with a machine learning model. Specifically, we propose using feed forward neural networks to perform the FFT operation with
similar or improved performance. By leveraging machine learning, we aim
to make the FFT process faster while maintaining the accuracy of traditional
methods.
